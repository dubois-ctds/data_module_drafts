Typically, the research question is something we want to know about a **population**. The population is the entire group we want to know something about. The population may be people, but it may be other things such as vehicles, objects or animals. For example, we may want to answer the questions:\n",

We collect data from this sample. **Data** is information or measurements that will help us answer the research question.\n",
